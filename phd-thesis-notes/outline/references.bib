	journal = {Metrologia},
	abstract = {This report describes the second CCM key comparison of realizations of the kilogram definition based on the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant, which came into force on 20 May 2019. The objectives were to determine the level of agreement between realizations of the kilogram using Kibble and joule balances and the x-ray crystal density (XRCD) method and to provide input for the calculation of the second "consensus value" of the kilogram. The consensus value serves as the basis for an internationally coordinated dissemination of the kilogram and is updated after each new key comparison. Its use will continue until satisfactory agreement between realization experiments has been achieved. Another objective was the determination of the reproducibility of the realization experiments by comparing the new results with those of the first key comparison of kilogram realizations, CCM.M-K8.2019.
	
	The comparison was organized by the BIPM and had nine participants. The BIPM, LNE, METAS, NIST, NRC and UME operated Kibble balances, the NIM used a joule balance and the NMIJ and the PTB participated using 28Si spheres, the masses of which were determined with the XRCD method. These realization methods were used to calibrate 1 kg mass standards under vacuum or in air. The standards were sent to the BIPM where they were compared with each other and with BIPM Pt-Ir working standards. The latter were calibrated traceable to the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), the mass of which served as the definition of the kilogram until 20 May 2019.
	
	The results of the weighings at the BIPM together with the measurement results communicated by the participants allowed comparison of the values attributed to 1 kg mass standards using the realization experiments of the participants. The level of agreement between mass determinations with the realization experiments and the BIPM as-maintained mass unit, traceable to the Planck constant through the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram, could also be deduced.

The result is based on over 10 000 weighings of masses with nominal values ranging from 0.5 kg to 2 kg with the Kibble balance NIST-4. The uncertainty has been reduced by more than twofold relative to a previous determination because of three factors: (1) a much larger data set than previously available, allowing a more realistic, and smaller, Type A evaluation; (2) a more comprehensive measurement of the back action of the weighing current on the magnet by weighing masses up to 2 kg, decreasing the uncertainty associated with magnet non-linearity; (3) a rigorous investigation of the dependence of the geometric factor on the coil velocity reducing the uncertainty assigned to time-dependent leakage of current in the coil.}

	journal = {Metrologia},
	abstract = {The joule balance experiment has been carried out at the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) since 2007. By the end of 2013 the first generation of the joule balance (NIM-1) achieved a measurement uncertainty of 7.2  ×  10−6 (k  =  1). To reduce the measurement uncertainty further, the next generation of the joule balance apparatus (NIM-2) system is under construction. A new coil system using ferromagnetic material is being adopted in NIM-2 to reduce self-heating in the coils. However, the effects on the measurement of the mutual inductance from the nonlinearity and hysteresis of the ferromagnetic material will bring a considerable measurement uncertainty. Inspired by the watt balance, the measurement of the mutual inductance is replaced by an equivalent measurement of the magnetic flux linkage difference. The nonlinearity and hysteresis will not be a problem in the measurement of the magnetic flux linkage difference. This technique comes from the watt balance method. It is called the generalized joule balance method, which is actually a modification of the watt balance method. However, it still represents a valid change that can reduce the difficulty of dynamic measurement experienced using the watt balance. Permanent magnets can also be adopted in the generalized joule balance. To check the feasibility of the generalized joule balance method, some preliminary experiments have been performed on NIM-1. A yokeless permanent magnet system has been designed and used to replace the exciting coils in NIM-1. In this paper, the structure of the yokeless permanent magnet system is introduced. Furthermore, a determination of the Planck constant with the permanent magnet system is presented. The value of the Planck constant h we obtained is 6.626 069(17)  ×  10−34 J s with a relative standard uncertainty of 2.6  ×  10−6.}

The comparisons made in the last hundred years have clearly revealed a long-term relative drift between the IPK and the official copies kept under similar conditions at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. A promising route towards a new definition of the kilogram based on a fundamental constant is represented by the watt balance experiment which links the mass unit to the Planck constant h. For more than ten years, the Federal Institute of Metrology METAS has been actively working in the conception and development of a watt balance experiment. This paper describes the new design of the Mark II METAS watt balance. The metrological characteristics of the different components of the experiment are described and discussed.}

We describe the theory underlying the Kibble balance and practical techniques required to construct such an instrument to relate a macroscopic physical mass to the Planck constant with an uncertainty, which is achievable at present, in the region of 2 parts in 108. A number of Kibble balances have either been built or are under construction and we compare the principal features of these balances.}

This paper collects together the alignment and correction techniques that have been developed at NPL over many years and are required to minimize the uncertainty of the measurement. Some of these techniques are applicable to all watt balances, whilst a few are specific to watt balances that employ a conventional beam balance to support a circular coil in a radial magnetic field, such as the NPL Mark II watt balance, now known as the NRC watt balance.}

Regarding the past evolution of the SI and the poor knowledge of the stability of the international prototype, its definition is not satisfactory. In the long term, it would be better to move to a definition based either on atomic properties or on fundamental constants. Among the various researches in progress in metrology laboratories, one of the most promising ways seems to be the watt balance. Its principle consists in comparing a mechanical power to an electromagnetic power. This comparison results from a measurement performed in two steps: a static measurement during which the Laplace force acting on a coil driven by a DC current and subjected to an induction field is compared to the weight of a standard mass, and a dynamic measurement where the induced voltage at the terminals of the same coil is determined when it is moved in the same field at a known velocity. The measurement of electrical quantities in terms of the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects then allows the mass unit be linked to the Planck constant. Although the principle of the experiment remains simple and direct, obtaining sufficiently low uncertainty ( 10-8) implies that devices relevant of various fields of physics must be implemented at their best level. In this paper, a review of the present developments at international level is presented.},

	title = {Watt balance experiments for the determination of the Planck constant and the redefinition of the kilogram*},
	journal = {Metrologia},
	abstract = {Since 1889 the international prototype of the kilogram has served as the definition of the unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). It is the last material artefact to define a base unit of the SI, and it influences several other base units. This situation is no longer acceptable in a time of ever increasing measurement precision.
	
	It is therefore planned to redefine the unit of mass by fixing the numerical value of the Planck constant. At the same time three other base units, the ampere, the kelvin and the mole, will be redefined. As a first step, the kilogram redefinition requires a highly accurate determination of the Planck constant in the present SI system, with a relative uncertainty of the order of 1 part in 108.
	
	The most promising experiment for this purpose, and for the future realization of the kilogram, is the watt balance. It compares mechanical and electrical power and makes use of two macroscopic quantum effects, thus creating a relationship between a macroscopic mass and the Planck constant.
	
	In this paper the background for the choice of the Planck constant for the kilogram redefinition is discussed and the role of the Planck constant in physics is briefly reviewed. The operating principle of watt balance experiments is explained and the existing experiments are reviewed. An overview is given of all presently available experimental determinations of the Planck constant, and it is shown that further investigation is needed before the redefinition of the kilogram can take place.}

The magnetic induction of a magnet is measured by weighing the force exerted on a rectangular current-carrying coil which has its lower end in the pole-gap. Simultaneously the precession frequency of protons in a water sample in this field is obtained by a conventional nuclear magnetic resonance technique. γ'p is then the ratio of the precession frequency to the magnetic flux density.
	
	The significance of the measurement lies not only in the use of the result to calibrate magnetic fields in SI units for other accurate measurements of atomic constants, but also in the realization of the SI definition of the ampere which follows from combining the result with the measurement of γ́p by the weak-field technique.

	journal = {Metrologia},
	abstract = {The method for realization of the kilogram using ‘superconducting magnetic levitation’ was re-evaluated at MIKES. The realization of the kilogram based on the traditional levitation method is limited by the imperfections of the superconducting materials and the indefinable dependence between supplied electrical energy and the gravitational potential energy of the superconducting mass. This indefiniteness is proportional to the applied magnetic field and is caused by increasing losses and trapped magnetic fluxes. A new design of an electromechanical system for the levitation method is proposed. In the proposed system the required magnetic field and the corresponding force are reduced, as the mass of the body (hanging from a mass comparator) is compensated by the reference weight on the mass comparator. The direction of the magnetic force can be upward (levitation force, when the body is over the coil) or downward (repulsive force, when the body is under the coil). The initial force to move the body from the coil is not needed and magnetic field sensitivity is increased, providing linearization of displacement versus applied current. This new construction allows a lower magnetic induction, reduces energy losses compared with previous designs of electromechanical system and reduces the corresponding systematic error.}
