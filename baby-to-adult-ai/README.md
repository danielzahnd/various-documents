This repository consists of a text and code folder. The text folder consists the latex files used to compile the text document, while the code folder contains the `python` and other code to reproduce the results shown in the document.

The project at hand is concerned with an AI model, which takes in a photo of the face of a baby and outputs a photo of the predicted adult face for that particular baby.
